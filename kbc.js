    Rules to play KBC:
      * The user will have 15 rounds
      * In each round, user will get a question
      * For each question, there are 4 choices out of which ONLY one is correct.
      * Prompt the user for input of Correct Option number and give feedback about right or wrong.
      * Each correct answer get the user money corresponding to the question and displays the next question.
      * If the user is:
          1. below questions number 5, then the minimum amount rewarded is Rs. 0 (zero)
          2. As he correctly answers question number 5, the minimum reward becomes Rs. 10,000 (First level)
          3. As he correctly answers question number 11, the minimum reward becomes Rs. 3,20,000 (Second Level)
      * If the answer is wrong, then the user will return with the minimum reward.
      * If the user inputs "lifeline" (case insensitive) as input, then hide two incorrect options and
          prompt again for the input of answer.
      * NOTE:
          50-50 lifeline can be used ONLY ONCE.
          There is no option of lifeline for the last question( ques no. 15 ), even if the user has not used it before.
      * If the user inputs "quit" (case insensitive) as input, then user returns with the amount he has won until now,
          instead of the minimum amount.
